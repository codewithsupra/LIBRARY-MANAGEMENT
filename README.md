The project,Bookstore management aims to tackle the problems most book
readers face today which is confusion when it comes to selecting top notch
books .The website helps us to not only display which are the top trending
books to read,it also displays best selling books from each category.In such a
manner ,users can easily select their books of choice and need not rush to a
bookstore. Users will no longer face doubts about what books to purchase and
if the books are really worth a read.The books are also delivered in an efficient
manner.All of these interactions are real time and thus there arises a need for
an efficient database management system, that can do it with minimal human
interaction.
